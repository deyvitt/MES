# 🚀 Using Your Existing Mamba Trainer with HuggingFace Datasets

Your existing `trainer.py` and `data_loader.py` are excellent! This guide shows how to enhance them with HuggingFace's open-source datasets.

## ✅ What You Already Have (Perfect!)

### Your Existing Training System:
- **`training/trainer.py`** - Sophisticated 4-phase training pipeline
- **`training/data_loader.py`** - Complete data loading infrastructure  
- **`training/optimizer.py`** - Advanced Mamba-specific optimization
- **`training/loss.py`** - Comprehensive loss functions
- **`core/config.py`** - Complete configuration system

### Your Training Pipeline:
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation training (shared weights)
2. **Phase 2**: Specialist training (domain experts)
3. **Phase 3**: Aggregator training (combining specialists)
4. **Phase 4**: End-to-end fine-tuning

This is **production-ready** and more advanced than most training systems!

## 🔗 HuggingFace Integration (Simple Addition)

### Step 1: Install HF Requirements
```bash
pip install -r hf_requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Quick Training with HF Data
```bash
# Uses your existing trainer with WikiText-103 dataset
python enhanced_training.py

# Quick test with tiny dataset
python enhanced_training.py --quick-test
```

### Step 3: Custom HF Dataset Training
```bash
# Download specific datasets
python train_with_hf_datasets.py --download-only

# Train with specific dataset
python enhanced_training.py --dataset "openwebtext"
```

## 📊 Popular HuggingFace Datasets You Can Use

### Language Modeling Datasets:
- **`wikitext-103-v1`** - Wikipedia articles (recommended for testing)
- **`openwebtext`** - Web text corpus (large, good for training)
- **`c4`** - Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (very large)
- **`pile`** - EleutherAI's diverse text dataset
- **`tiny_shakespeare`** - Small dataset for quick testing

### Domain-Specific Datasets:
- **Medical**: `pubmed_qa`, `bioasq`
- **Legal**: `lex_glue`
- **Code**: `codeparrot/github-code`, `bigcode/the-stack`
- **Science**: `scientific_papers`

## 🎯 How It Integrates With Your System

### Your Existing Data Loader Enhancement:
The HF integration simply:
1. Downloads datasets from HuggingFace
2. Converts them to your expected text format
3. Saves as `train_data.txt` 
4. Your existing `MambaDataset` loads it normally

### Your Existing Config Usage:
```python
# Your existing config works perfectly
config = MambaConfig(
    vocab_size=50257,
    d_model=1024,
    n_layers=12,
    batch_size=4,
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    num_specialists=50,
    train_data_path="train_data.txt"  # HF dataset converted to this
)

# Your existing trainer
trainer = MambaSwarmTrainer(config)
trainer.full_training_pipeline()  # Uses your 4-phase system
```

## 🏃 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Test Your Existing System:
```bash
# Use your existing trainer as-is
python -c "
from core.config import MambaConfig
from training.trainer import MambaSwarmTrainer

config = MambaConfig()
trainer = MambaSwarmTrainer(config)
trainer.train_foundation_phase(num_steps=100)  # Quick test
"
```

### 2. Add HuggingFace Data:
```bash
# Download WikiText and train with your system
python enhanced_training.py
```

### 3. Train with Different HF Datasets:
```bash
# Shakespeare (tiny, for testing)
python enhanced_training.py --dataset tiny_shakespeare

# OpenWebText (larger, for real training)  
python enhanced_training.py --dataset openwebtext
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Examples

### Small Model (Quick Testing):
```python
config = MambaConfig(
    d_model=512,
    n_layers=6,
    batch_size=2,
    num_specialists=10,
    max_steps=1000
)
```

### Production Model:
```python
config = MambaConfig(
    d_model=1024, 
    n_layers=12,
    batch_size=8,
    num_specialists=50,
    max_steps=50000
)
```

### Large Model (If you have GPU):
```python
config = MambaConfig(
    d_model=2048,
    n_layers=24, 
    batch_size=4,
    num_specialists=100,
    max_steps=100000
)
```

## 🔍 What Gets Enhanced

### Your `app.py` Now Detects:
1. **Custom Trained Models** (Priority 1-9) 
2. **Standard Mamba Models** (Priority 10-19)
3. **GPT Fallbacks** (Priority 20+)

When you train a model, it gets **highest priority** automatically!

### Example Status Display:
```
🎯 CUSTOM TRAINED MAMBA ENCODER
Status: 🟢 Custom Model Online | Model: Custom Trained: mamba_swarm_hf_trained (1024D)
```
